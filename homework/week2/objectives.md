### Skills

_You should be able to:_

* Use Firefox's scratchpad for writing, loading, and evaluating short blocks of code.

* Build strings incrementally by concatenating separate and sometimes-optional components.

* Understand the difference between printing a string (via `console.log()`) and setting or retrieving its value.

* Write `while` and `for` loops:

	* simplify loops and conditionals to simpler forms which behave equivalently;

	* identify the correct halting and continuation conditions for the loop;

	* ensure that the iterator variable changes in a way which will eventually halt;

	* nest one loop inside another, and understand their behavior.

* Manipulate basic arrays:

	* Create arrays of primitives using array-literal notation (`[1,2,3...]`) and store them as variables;

	* Pass an array as an argument to a function;

	* Retrieve and set individual elements;

	* Find an array's length.

* Functions:

	* Organize related blocks of code into functions with:
		* a well-defined purpose,
		* a name effectively communicating that purpose,
		* parameters which represent the information for 'customizing' one function call,
		* local variables for short-term values, 
		* a meaningful return value.

	* Call functions, provide any necessary arguments, and capture their returned value;

	* Guard against invalid function parameters and return an appropriate 'failure' value.

* Testing:

	* Write a simple `assert` function for basic testing.

	* Write assertion statements to check that your code produces the correct output for various success cases.

	* Write assertion statements to check that your code produces failure values for various failure cases.
