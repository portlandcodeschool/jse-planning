### Skills

_You should be able to:_

* Construct objects using object literal notation or incremental property assignment.

* Understand the differences between variables and properties.

* Access object properties using both the dot ('.') and index ('[]') operators, and understand the difference between them.

* Retrieve all of an object's keys and loop over them.

* Distinguish basic object patterns (instance, index, toolbox) and identify examples when seen.

* Write basic object methods using the keyword `this` and call them correctly.

* Understand the behavior and return values of basic array methods: `push`, `pop`, `join`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `concat`

* Understand arrays as a special class of Object and be able to simulate basic array behavior with pseudo-arrays.


#### References

* Understand how object references work.

* Trace the creation of objects and the assignment and redirection of variables which reference them.

* Understand the difference between aliasing, shallow-copying, and deep-copying.

* Construct a network of objects by connecting objects with references to each other.  Traverse paths between objects with chains of membership operators.


#### Testing

* Understand the basic principles of unit-testing: _functions testing other functions through assertions_.

* Be able to write an assertion function from scratch, and write testing functions which make multiple assertions.
