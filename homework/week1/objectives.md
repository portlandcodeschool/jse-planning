### Jargon

_You should understand the meaning and behavior of the following:_

* Operators and keywords:

```
+ - / * %
== === != !== < > <= >=
= += -= /= *= %=
++_ --_ _++ _--
! && || _?_:_
typeof
var
if ()
if () else ()
```

* Special primitives:

```
true
false
undefined
''
NaN
Infinity
```

* Vocabulary:

infix, prefix, postfix, unary, binary, ternary,
evaluation, operator, operand,
number, integer, float, string, numeric string,
boolean, expression, statement, primitive,
auto-conversion, parsing, precedence,
declare, initialize, keyword, REPL, mod,
conditional, condition, consequent, block, short-circuit, truthy/truish, falsey/falsish

### Skills
_You should be able to:_

* Work confidently in the console of at least one browser.

* Declare and initialize variables, and use assignment and incremental assignment operators to modify them.

* Articulate branching conditions both with and without boolean operators.

* Use short-circuit boolean operators in conditional evaluation.

* Anticipate the behavior of special Numbers (_NaN, Infinity_) and non-integers in computations.

* Use common mathematical functions from the Math and Number objects.

* Manipulate variables to represent and solve simple arithmetic and geometric problems.

* Parse any expression, deconstructing it into a tree of constituent expressions and tracing their evaluation in the correct order.

* Notice all operators with side-effects and track any changes in the value of variables.

* Predict the exact result of any expression whose constituent values are known (to a reasonable precision, if numeric).

* Reason about the possible behavior of expressions which contain some unknown values.
