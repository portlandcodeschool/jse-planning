Homework #3


---

**1) A Card Factory**  _[Easyish, 1.5 hrs]_
Revisit your playing card functions from homework 3 and repackage them in a Factory pattern.  You will replace the earlier cardReader toolkit object with a single master function
`makeCard(id)` (the Factory) which, with each call, makes and returns an object representing a single card.  If _id_ is invalid, the factory should instead return _null_.  Each valid card object remembers its own _id_ and has instance methods to calculate its other attributes and relations.  Because each card knows its own id, the instance methods need no argument and have these signatures:

* rank() --> 1..4
* suit() --> 1..4
* color()--> string
* name() --> string

Try to avoid redundant copies of the various methods.  To share methods between card instances, make them methods of the factory itself and link card instances to them.

In addition to the four instance methods above, write another method which is called only through the factory:

* makeCard.isCard(obj) --> true if obj is a valid card object

If you need helper functions (e.g. for validating arguments), you may attach them as additional factory methods.  Note also that _makeCard_ cannot have a method named 'name', so change that shared factory method name to something else.  Here is a [template file](cards3-template.js).

**2) Stacking the Deque**

"Deque" (pronounced "deck") is an acronym for "double-ended queue", a sequential data structure similar to an Array but with different rules of access.  While an Array is random-access (i.e. any element is accessible), a deque can only be accessed at either of its ends (like a roll of mints with both ends open).  The two ends can be called "top" and "bottom".

**a)** _[Moderate, 2.5 hrs]_
Write a deque factory, a function `makeDeque(values)` which follows the Factory pattern.  Each call to `makeDeque(values)` should build and return a new deque instance, which holds a copy (not just an alias!) of the array _values_.  Each deque instance has the following methods, which are shared by all deques and the factory itself:

* `top()`: return the element on top of the deque

* `bottom()`: return the element on bottom of the deque

* `pop()`:  remove and return the top element

* `push(val)`: add an element to the top

* `shift()`: remove and return the bottom element

* `unshift(val)`: add an element to the bottom

* `cut()`: split the deque at the middle, then swap the two halves.  If there are an odd number of deque elements, split just above the middle element.  The element just below the split will become the new top element when the halves are swapped.

* `sort(compareValsFn)`: reorder all elements of the deque according to the comparison defined by the function _compareValsFn_, passed as an argument to _sort_.
`compareValsFn(a,b)` should return a positive number whenever value _a_  belongs somewhere below value _b_ in the sorted result, and a negative number whenever _a_ belongs above _b_.  (Zero means they're equivalent: either may come first.)

* `map(convertValFn)`: return an array whose elements are derived from the values in deque, converting each value with the function `convertValFn(val)`.

In part b), you'll use a deque to simulate a deck of 52 cards, but your deque implementation should be completely general, able to handle any number of any type of element.

Although it would be possible to implement a deque as an Array instance, for this exercise make it an ordinary object which **contains** an Array, a copy of the _values_ parameter.
Be sure to **copy** the _values_ array into the deque instead of using the original; you don't want anyone messing with the deque's content through another reference.

Use the [template file](deque-template.js) to get started.

**b)** _[Easy, 1/2 hr]_
Use your _makeCard_ factory from Problem 1) to create _someCards_, an array of 52 different card objects.  The factory should have given each card some methods to retrieve its own name, color, etc.

Figure 1 below represents the structures you should have after parts a) and b).

**c)** _[Easyish, 1hr]_
Use your factory _makeDeque_ to create _deckOfCards_, a deque holding the cards in _someCards_.  Figure 2 represents the new structure:

![](http://portlandcodeschool.github.io/jse-fall14-4/deque2.svg)

Write a comparison function to sort _deck_ by card ID, with card 51 (King of Clubs) on top.
Make sure the sorted deck passes the tests below:
```
var deck = makeDeque(/*something*/);
deck.sort(/*something*/);
deck.cut();
assert(deck.top().name() === 'Seven of Diamonds', 'Failed Seven of Diamonds test');
```

Now sort the deck by card name, alphabetically from bottom to top.   (Hint: You'll need to write a new comparison function.)
```
deck.sort(/* something new*/);
assert(deck.bottom().name() === 'Ace of Clubs', 'Failed Ace of Clubs test');
assert(deck.top().name() === 'Two of Spades', 'Failed Two of Spades test');

```

**d)** _[Easy, 1/2 hr]_
Without changing your deque factory, use it to create another deque which holds the names of all 10 students in this class.
Sort the names alphabetically, bottom to top, by the SECOND letter of the name (e.g. "Dan" would precede "Ben" because 'a'<'e').  Then test it:
```
var everyone = makeDeque(/*something*/);
everyone.sort(/*something*/);
var theFinalName = '/*someone*/'; //whoever is last via that sort
assert(everyone.top() === theFinalName, 'Failed name test');
```

**e)** _[Easyish, 2 hrs]_ 
In your factory, add a deque method `shuffle()` which shuffles the elements into a random order.
First, try the easy (but slow and ineffective) way by using Array.sort() with a comparison function returning a random result.

Then do it properly using the [in-place Knuth-Fisher-Yates algorithm](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/).

With the new factory definition, create a new _deckOfCards_ and shuffle it.
Use its _map(...)_ method with a custom callback function to view the shuffled elements by card.id.
Then use _map(...)_ with a different callback function to view them by card.name().

---

**f)** _[Moderate, 2 hrs]_
Improve your deque implementation to ensure that no one can add unauthorized elements to it (e.g. extra Aces).
Change anything necessary so that `push(val)` and `unshift(val)` only add _val_ if it was part of the original deque and is currently missing (via `pop()` or `shift()`).

(Hint: each deque will need some kind of inventory of all elements released with a _pop_ or _shift_.)
